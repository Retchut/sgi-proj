## Projects

### [TP1 - Scene Graph](tp1)

- The primitives were correctly specified, and the guidelines were followed.
- The parser is quite robust, throwing warnings when the XML file has invalid components, but still rendering the scene in most cases.
- The interface is very user friendly, allowing to change views, toggle lights, and show the lights' positions.
- Scene
  - The demonstration scene consists of some planets from an alternative universe with different laws of physics. The sun in the middle has some objects on it.
  - [General View of the Scene]()
  - [Scene XML](tp1/scenes/demo.xml)
